# gateway-tools
Scripts that run on the gateway for monitoring.

Separate repo from `gateway` because we want to be able to freely
`git pull` without worrying about changing the core
gateway code.

These scripts will help with monitoring the gateway and deployments.

We are using `sensu` right now.
